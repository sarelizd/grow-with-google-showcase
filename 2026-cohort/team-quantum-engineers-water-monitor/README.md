## 🎯 What AquaWatch Naija Does (and Why It Matters)

* **Problem Statement:** Community members lack a central, accessible public dashboard to view municipal water testing results and safety warnings.
* **Solution Summary:** AquaWatch Naija is a centralized, interactive web application designed to transform water quality data into actionable, easy-to-understand insights. This project bridges the gap between complex public health data and everyday community awareness, empowering residents to monitor local safety levels and track historical sanitation metrics.
* **A note on data provenance:** No single, unified public feed of Nigerian municipal water testing results currently exists, which is itself part of the access problem this project addresses. AquaWatch Naija approximates that missing central dashboard by combining a large public water-quality dataset with two peer-reviewed regional case studies (see [Research & Data](#research-data)) into one consistent, dashboard-ready format. The result models what a real municipal testing dashboard would look and feel like, using the best available public and academic data as a stand-in for direct municipal feeds.

*"Naija" is a common, everyday nickname for Nigeria, used widely by Nigerians themselves. The name reflects that this dashboard is built for and by the communities it serves.*

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Interactive Dashboard** | Visualizes water testing results in an accessible, non-technical format, with sidebar filters by Region and Water Source Type. |
| **Color-Coded Safety Map** | An interactive map plots every test site and color-codes it Green (Safe), Orange (Moderate Risk), or Red (High Risk); hovering a point shows the year, region, water source, risk level, and reason. |
| **Year-Tagged Records** | The Kaggle dataset and regional case studies include water testing results from 2000-2024. Every test result is tagged by year, and the year is surfaced throughout the dashboard. The year is indicated in the first column in both data tables, in the map's hover tooltip, and in the Community Action Steps guidance, so users always know how current a reading is. |
| **Contamination Threshold Alerts** | Highlights when key safety indicators (pH, turbidity, bacteria count, contaminant level) cross public health thresholds, with dedicated Safe / Moderate Risk / High Risk banners. |
| **Disease Indicator / Risk Column** | Surfaces the original field-recorded public health notes where available, and otherwise names whichever disease (Cholera, Typhoid, or Diarrheal) has the highest reported incidence for that record. |
| **Data Standardization Pipeline** | Cleans and aggregates data from disparate public and academic sources, standardizing them into one consistent schema. |

### Methodology

This project combines a national dataset with two peer-reviewed regional case studies to build a hyperlocal, Nigeria-specific water quality picture, standing in for the centralized municipal dashboard described in the problem statement.

* The Kaggle dataset (3,000 records across multiple countries) was filtered down to Nigeria-only records, producing an initial Nigeria dataset covering the regions South, Central, East, North, and West.
* Water quality measurements from the two peer-reviewed case studies were extracted and standardized into a matching format:
  * The Jabi Lake study contributed the **Abuja (FCT)** data.
  * The Benue South study contributed data for the **Benue South Senatorial District**, drawing on water sources across three Local Government Areas (LGAs) within Benue State, Nigeria: **Otukpo, Ohimini, and Apa**.

  > **Note:** Benue South is not the same as the broad "South" region from the Kaggle dataset, which spans multiple, unrelated parts of the country. "South" and "Benue South" are two distinct regions from two different sources and are kept separate throughout the dataset and the dashboard.

The Nigeria-filtered Kaggle data and the two case-study datasets were merged into a single finalized dataset (`nigeria_combined_water_data.csv`), which powers the dashboard.

Data cleaning, metric standardization, and exploratory data analysis were used throughout to isolate key contamination thresholds and safety indicators for public consumption.

### How risk is calculated

Only pH (6.5 to 8.5) and Turbidity (5.0 NTU or below) are official WHO guideline values. Bacteria (1000 CFU/mL or below) and Contaminant Level (7.0 ppm or below) are dataset-calibrated cutoffs instead, since the source data doesn't specify which pathogen or contaminant was tested. A sample is High Risk at 2 or more threshold breaches, Moderate Risk at 1, and Safe at 0.

Risk Level and Disease Indicator / Risk are separate signals. Risk Level checks whether a water sample passes its own safety checks. Disease Indicator / Risk checks whether the region is seeing higher rates of Cholera, Typhoid, or Diarrheal disease (the 9 Abuja/Benue South sites without regional disease data show the original field contamination note instead). Regional illness can stem from causes beyond a single water sample, such as storage, distribution, sanitation, or a past outbreak. Because of that, a sample can read Safe even in a High-disease-indicator region. That's expected, not an error.

## 🚀 Live App & Setup Instructions

### Option A: Use the live app (no setup required)

👉 **[team-quantum-engineers-water-monitor.streamlit.app](https://team-quantum-engineers-water-monitor.streamlit.app/)**

This is the fastest way to explore the dashboard. Filter by region and water source, view the safety map, and browse the full testing results table, all in your browser.

### Option B: Run it locally

Running locally is useful if you want to read or modify the code, rather than just view the dashboard.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MentorMeCollective/grow-with-google-showcase.git

# Navigate to the assigned team directory
cd 2026-cohort/team-quantum-engineers-water-monitor

# Check out our team's working branch
git checkout team-quantum-engineers

# Move into the src folder (app.py, requirements.txt, and the CSV all live here together)
cd src

# Install dependencies (only needs to be done once)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`. The app expects `app.py` and `nigeria_combined_water_data.csv` to be in the same folder. If you move one, move the other with it.

> **A note on versions:** `requirements.txt` pins exact package versions (e.g., `streamlit==1.60.0`). If you install a newer version of Streamlit than the one pinned there, some layout or styling behavior may differ slightly from what's described in this README. For the closest match to the live app, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` as-is rather than upgrading the packages individually.

> **A note on the code:** The codebase is thoroughly commented to support the Mentor Me Collective community, ensuring future Scholars can easily understand and build upon this automated data pipeline.

## 🗺️ Implementation Plan

**Timeline:** July 15 to August 14, 2026 (BUILD Project window)

| Phase | Task |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Source and clean data by filtering Kaggle dataset to Nigeria, extract and standardize data from two peer-reviewed case studies, and merge into final combined dataset. |
| Phase 2 | Convert finalized dataset to CSV and build the Streamlit dashboard (which includes filtering by region and water source type, risk classification, interactive map, summary metrics, and data tables). |
| Phase 3 | Test the app locally, confirm setup instructions work end-to-end, and finalize README and repo structure. |
| Phase 4 | Record 5-minute project walkthrough video and link it in the README. |
| Phase 5 | Submit final review and submission via pull request to `main` on the `team-quantum-engineers` branch. |

**Resources:**

* **Data:** Kaggle dataset plus two peer-reviewed academic case studies (see [Research & Data](#research-data) for full details)
* **Tools:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, pydeck, CSS

**Risks & Mitigation:**

* **Data inconsistency across sources:** Since the dataset merges a general Kaggle dataset with two independently collected academic studies, column names and formats needed to be manually standardized before merging. This was addressed by aligning column names and units across all three sources before combining them into the final dataset.
* **Team members' unfamiliarity with Streamlit and GitHub:** Several team members are new to Streamlit and GitHub. This was mitigated by working collaboratively through co-working sessions and peer code review of each other's work.
* **AI-assisted development:** The team used Claude, an AI assistant, to help draft and troubleshoot portions of the Python codebase. Since AI-suggested code isn't guaranteed to be correct or optimal, every AI-assisted change was reviewed, tested, and adjusted by the team before being merged, in addition to the peer code review noted above.
* **Dependency and version drift:** `requirements.txt` pins exact package versions (e.g., `streamlit==1.60.0`) rather than open-ended version ranges. This protects the deployed app from unannounced behavior or styling changes if Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, or pydeck release a new version. The app keeps using the tested version pins unless the team deliberately upgrades and re-tests.
* **No direct municipal data feed:** Nigeria does not currently offer a unified public API or feed of official municipal water testing results, which is part of the underlying access problem. This was mitigated by grounding the dashboard in a large public dataset plus two peer-reviewed regional case studies, so the app still reflects real-world testing data rather than synthetic figures. Future work could pursue direct partnerships with municipal water authorities (see [Future Ideas](#future-ideas)).

## 💡 Future Ideas

* Add a year-over-year trend visualization (e.g., average contaminant and bacteria levels by year) to surface long-term sanitation patterns, building on the year-tagged records already in the dataset.
* Expand data ingestion to incorporate real-time automated IoT sensor feeds from local water treatment facilities.
* Partner directly with municipal water authorities to source live official testing results, moving the dashboard from academic/public-dataset-backed data toward a true real-time municipal feed.
* Integrate an automated multi-language notification service to alert community residents via SMS regarding urgent water quality shifts.
* Introduce user login feature so community members can save the region(s) they care about and receive personalized alerts when local readings change, rather than checking the dashboard manually. Because this would mean storing user accounts and preferences, it should be built alongside:
  * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, so different account types (e.g., community members vs. municipal administrators) see only the data and controls appropriate to their role.
  * **Data encryption**, so that account credentials and any stored personal information are protected both in transit and at rest.
